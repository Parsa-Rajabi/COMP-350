# AI-usage Course Policy

## Disclosure of AI Use

- Link to the AI Use Disclosure Form TBA

## Policy on the Use of AI Content Generators for Coursework.

As Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) gains traction, its impact on post-secondary education is increasingly being debated. Some argue that it will make education more accessible, while others worry about its potential to replace human teachers. In this course policy, I will outline how I will tackle this challenge in COMP 350 - User Interface Design and Programming. Please note that this policy only applies to COMPT 350 AB1 in Winter 2025.

In a nutshell, the use of AI tools is permitted for all course content such assignments, learning logs. Using tools such as ChatGPT will not be allowed during in-person midterm. As part of the course policy, students are required to disclose any use of AI tools for each submission. Failure to follow this policy will be considered a violation of the course/university's academic policy.

## General Guidelines

## I view AI tools as a powerful resource that you can learn to embrace.

The goal is to develop your resilience to automation, as these tools will become increasingly prevalent in the future. By incorporating these tools into your work process, you will be able to focus on skills that will remain relevant despite the rise of automation. Furthermore, I believe that these tools can be beneficial for students that consider English as their second and those who have been disadvantaged, allowing them to express their ideas in a more articulate and efficient manner.

## Using AI for learning 

I encourage you to use AI tools to help you learn and develop your understanding of the course material. For example, you can use AI tools to generate summaries of readings, create flashcards, or even generate questions to test your knowledge. Throughout the course, I will provide you with resources (e.g. prompts) and guidance on how to use these tools effectively. You can use these tools to test your understanding of the material, but you should not rely on them as the sole source of information.

## I am aware that there are risks involved in allowing the use of AI tools in your deliverables.

Therefore, I ask that you read this carefully and use the tools responsibly and ethically.

Firstly, it is important to note that AI tools are susceptible to errors and may incorporate discriminatory ideas in their output. As a student, **it is your responsibility to ensure the quality and appropriateness of the work you submit in this course**.

Secondly, please be mindful of the data you provide to these systems, as your assignments and learning logs may contain private information, not just your own but also that of others. For example, you should never enter the names of your classmates or the individuals who are peer reviewing, into generative AI tools such as ChatGPT. 

Thirdly, there is a **risk of inadvertently plagiarizing** when using these tools. Many AI chatbots and image generators create content based on existing bodies of work without proper citation. In addition, other students may use these tools to generate content that is similar to yours. Therefore, it is important to **cite your sources** and **use the tools responsibly**. **Our plagiarism policy will apply to every course submissions, and "AI did it!" will not excuse any plagiarism**. 

Lastly, be aware of the dangers of becoming overly dependent on these tools. While they can be incredibly useful, relying on them too much can diminish your own critical thinking and writing skills.

## For every assignment submission, you are required to submit an "AI usage disclosure" 

Submitting this disclosure will help us understand and mitigate the risks associated with the use of AI tools in the course. The form will ask about your use of AI tools for the assignment and the extent to which you used them. Failure to submit the disclosure will be considered a violation of the academic policy and a penalty of` -25%` will be applied to your grade if the disclosure is not submitted / attached to each of your submissions.

## For every learnig log submission, you are required to disclose the use of AI tools

For every learning log submission, students will include a brief statement declaring how much AI was used in their response. This declaration is based on the AI Usage Scale provided in the syllabus and detailed below. The declaration will help the teaching team and your peers understand the context of your work.

Similar to the AI usage disclosure for assignments, failure to include this statement will be considered a violation of the academic policy and a penalty of `-25%` will be applied to your grade if the disclosure is not included in your submission.

### AI Usage Scale

Select one of the following options (make sure to include the icon/emoji) to indicate the extent of AI use in your learning log submission:

<div class="accordion">

<details>
  <summary>ðŸŸ¢ Entirely by myself, no contribution from AI</summary>
  <p>The response was created entirely by the student without using AI tools.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>ðŸŸ¡ Mostly by myself, some contribution by AI</summary>
  <p>AI was used minimally, for tasks like grammar checks, clarifications, or rephrasing.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>ðŸŸ  Evenly split between myself and AI</summary>
  <p>The response reflects equal contributions from the student and AI, such as brainstorming or content generation with subsequent student refinements.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”µ Mostly by AI, some contribution by myself</summary>
  <p>AI generated most of the content, and the student reviewed and made minor adjustments.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>ðŸ”´ Entirely by AI, no contribution from myself</summary>
  <p>The response was fully created by AI and reviewed by the student for accuracy.</p>
</details>

</div>

## AI Use for Assignment 3

Although the use of AI tools is permitted for the assignments, the teaching team will be more stringent in auditing the use of AI tools for assignment 3. This is to ensure that students are not overly dependent on AI tools and that they are able to demonstrate their understanding of the course material. The instructor will conduct interviews with students to discuss their use of AI tools for assignment 3 and assess their understanding of the assignment content. Students who are unable to demonstrate their understanding of assignment 3 will be penalized through grade deductions and/or other measures.

## Audits of AI Disclosure Forms and Student Work

To uphold the integrity of coursework, the instructor will conduct regular audits of random studentsâ€™ AI use disclosure forms throughout the semester. These audits will involve scheduled interviews where students will discuss their use of AI tools in assignments and learning logs. Additionally, the instructor will cross-reference the submitted work with the details provided in the disclosure forms.

If any inconsistencies are found between the disclosed AI usage and the actual content of the work, the student may be asked to provide further clarification. Persistent discrepancies or failure to provide a satisfactory explanation could lead to a review for potential academic integrity violations. These audits will be conducted continuously to ensure transparency and adherence to the AI usage policy, fostering a fair academic environment for all students.

## If you do not wish to use these tools, that is a valid decision.

The use of AI tools in education can be messy and unpredictable due to the risks mentioned earlier. Some students may have moral confusion or concerns about the uncertainty associated with using AI tools in their coursework. **If you do not wish to use them, that is a valid decision.** This policy aims to anticipate and mitigate any potential harms associated with AI tool usage, rather than promoting their use.

## I will not mark you down for the use or non-use of AI tools.

Grading will be done based on the rubric on an absolute scale, the use of AI tools will not negatively impact your grade.

**Please note that this policy on the use of AI tools is up for change as the term progresses. Changes will be communicated in-class and via this page.**

Questions about this policy can be directed to the instructor via email with the following email header: _[COMP 350 - AI Policy]_.
