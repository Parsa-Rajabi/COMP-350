# Heuristic Evaluation Template

- Screenshot/Image of the interface, with specific area of interest highlighted. Submission without annotations will result in a deduction of `-1 mark`.

## Name
- Succinct but descriptive name for problem or good aspect

## Problem/Good
- State the most relevant heuristic

## Relevant Heuristic
- Recognition rather than recall

## Evidence of issue
- Indicate where the issue is within the user interface. This should complement the screenshot/image provided above.

## Detailed explanation (max 100 words)
- A detailed explanation of how the relevant heuristic is violated (for problems) or met (for good aspects). If making assumptions about user behavior (e.g. what the user will or will not be familiar with) include evidence to support your assumptions.

## Severity (minor, major, critical)
- Use a scale of 2 (minor), 3 (major) or 4 (critical)

## Justification (max 240 words; 60 words each)
- Justify your numerical severity rating with the factors of frequency, impact, and persistence. Also include how you assessed their weighting:
  - **Frequency:** How often does the issue occur?
  - **Impact:** How severely does the issue affect the user's experience?
  - **Persistence:** How long does the issue last, and how difficult is it to overcome?
  - **Weighting:** How did you decide on the severity rating?
- If you're evaluating a good aspect, justify why it's a good aspect and how it contributes to the user experience:
  - **Frequency:** How often does the good aspect occur?
  - **Impact:** How positively does the good aspect affect the user's experience? What would happen if it were not present?
  - **Value:** How much value does the good aspect add to the user experience? What makes it stand out?
  - **Weighting:** How did you decide on the rating for the good aspect?
