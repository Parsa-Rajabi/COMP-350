## Drop-in Help

During weeks when we have asynchronous classes, our dedicated lab monitor, Aastha, will be available via Zoom (link on course info page) during your designated class hours to provide real-time assistance with any questions or difficulties you might have regarding the course material.

Here’s how the drop-in sessions will work:
- Students will be placed in a virtual waiting room upon joining. Aastha will assist each student on a first-come, first-served basis.
- Please remain on the Zoom call until it’s your turn for assistance.

Astha will also be available on an ad-hoc basis during the weeks that we have live class. Please check the [course syllabus](home.md) for her email address.
