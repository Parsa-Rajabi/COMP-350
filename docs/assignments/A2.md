# Assignment 2 - Due March 4

> [!NOTE]
> This assignment can be done individually or in groups of 2-3 students.  You must inform the instructor (via email) of your group members by **February 10**. 

> [!DANGER]
> Students who do not inform the instructor and work in a group will be subject to a penalty.

> [!TIP]
> If you choose to work in a group, you will be graded as a group.  If you choose to work individually, you will be graded individually.

### Context: Heuristic Evaluation/Interfaces Critique
This assignments aims to get you started with having an eye of a user interface designer and be able to critically evaluate an interface. In the first part, you will search for different user interfaces and critique them. In the second part, you will evaluate one of the interfaces through heuristic evaluation.

### Part 1: User Interface Critique `[6 marks]`

For each of the following categories, find 2 user interfaces you use regularly (total of 6 interfaces): 

> [!WARNING]
> If you're working in a group, then you will need to multiple the number of interfaces by the number of group members. For example, if you're in a group of 2, then you will need to find 4 (2 interfaces per category x 2 group members) user interfaces for each category (total of 12 interfaces).


1. Bad User Interfaces `[2 marks]`
2. Good User Interfaces `[2 marks]`
3. AI-Based User Interfaces `[2 marks]`

For each interface:

- **Screenshots/Image:** Provide a screenshot or clear image showing the interface. Make sure your images/screenshots are clear and easy to read (`-0.5 marks` will be deducted for each blurry images / screenshot that is hard to read. Submission without a screenshot/image will result in a grade of `0`).
- `[1 mark]` **Description:** Provide a brief description of the interface and how you use it. 
- **Analysis:** Depending on the interface, provide an analysis of the interface based on the following criteria. Make sure to provide a detailed explanation for each aspect.
   - `[1 mark]` **Bad Interface:** List 2 aspects that you think are **bad** about the interface and why. 
   - `[1 mark]` **Good Interface:** List 2 aspects that you think are **good** about the interface and why.
   - `[1 mark]` **AI-Based Interface:** List 2 aspects that you think are **good** AND 2 aspects that are **bad** about the interface and why. 

Note: AI-based interfaces include applications/services that use AI to provide a service or enhance the user experience. Try to find interfaces that are beyond the basic AI features (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems, etc.).

### Part 2: Heuristic Evaluation `[20 marks (10 each)]`

Choose two of the interfaces you critiqued in Part 1 and perform a heuristic evaluation on it (based on [10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)). Clearly indicate which interface (good/bad/AI-based) you are evaluating. 

> [!WARNING]
> If you're working in a group, then you will need to multiple the number of interfaces by the number of group members. For example, if you're in a group of 2, then you will need to choose 4 (2 interfaces x 2 group members) interfaces for heuristic evaluation.


Complete the Usability Inspection Report Template* for each interface you are evaluating:

   - [Heuristic Evaluation Template](./assignments/A2-assets/A2-assets/HE-template-clean.md)
   - [Heuristic Evaluation Example](./assignments/A2-assets/A2-assets/HE-example.md)

Heuristic Evaluations will be graded based on the following criteria:
- `[2 mark]` Strong evidence of understanding of usability heuristics and their application
- `[2 mark]` Evidence of Issues (screenshots and text)
- `[2 mark]` Issue Names and Explanations (incl. clarity)
- `[2 mark]` Assigned Severity Ratings & Justifications (incl. clarity)
- `[2 mark]` Comprehensiveness, relevance and writing clarity, and adherence to work limits
