# Final Project

As mentioned in class, there will be a final project in lieu of a final exam. The final project will be a comprehensive project that will test your knowledge of the course material. 

## Project Rules

- You must complete the test BY YOURSELF (no friends, no tutors, no classmates, no humans).
- The test is open-book, open-notes EXCEPT websites and plugins that help you cheat such as ChatGPT, BingAI, Chegg, Course Hero, Slader and other similar websites that have tutors answering questions 
- Copying the question text and googling **IS CHEATING**
- Posting the question text and asking someone to solve it for you **IS CHEATING**
- Using google to search for concepts is NOT cheating (however using any AI-based search engine i.e. BingAI **IS CHEATING**)
- If you come across the same or similar question on google, resist the temptation to keep reading, and close your browser tab
- Do NOT share quiz questions with anyone: that **IS CHEATING**

> [!WARNING]
> Individuals who are suspected of violating these rules will be held accountable and will undergo the appropriate academic integrity procedures. This may result in a failing grade for the project, and potentially failing the course. Make sure you understand the rules and follow them.
